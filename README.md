# Samples.MachineLearning

Playground and samples for Machine Learning with .NET (Core) with various APIs (frameworks):

*   ML.net

*   TensorFlow

*   ...

The main motivation was to convert academic infidel ([katodix]) to start using industry strength
technologies and nor only R, Python, Matlab/Octave, Statistica, SPSS, etc...

Usually there will be original sample (console app for ML.net) and then that sample will be split
into:

1.  learning phase (app or scripts)

2.  consuming/testing/using/predicting phase (app or scripts)

The main goal is to create set of scripts and to free academic user of the burdain of project 
(build) system understanding concepts of libraries and applications. Then Mr.Professor can play
with scripts, data, algorithms and after he is done with playing, the real tough guys ([sasa] and 
[moljac]) will integrate C# code from scripts into real world applications (mobile with Xamarin, 
ASP.net Core, Desktop UWP, AppKit, etc...)
